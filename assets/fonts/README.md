# Font Files

This directory contains font files used in the VibeBorn application.

These fonts are used for their mystical appearance that fits the game's theme:

- **CaslonAntique.ttf**: Used for body text throughout the app
- **Supernatural.ttf**: Used for titles and headers

## Important Note

For the real application, you would need to:

1. Purchase proper licenses for these fonts if they are not free for commercial use
2. Implement the fonts using `@expo-google-fonts` packages where possible
3. Add fallback fonts for better cross-platform compatibility

## TODO:

- Replace with properly licensed fonts from Google Fonts if possible
- Implement loading using expo-font
- Add proper attribution for font creators
